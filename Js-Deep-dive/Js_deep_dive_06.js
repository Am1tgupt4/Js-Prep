// Section 6: TypeSystems: TypeScript & Flow

// Lecture 1: TypeScript, Flow and type-aware linting

/*
  - Linting: A tool to apply opinion about the code.
  - A team should have style guide and everyone should aligned with it.
  
  TypeScript | Flow
  - Kyle says he does not use it because he already solved it using vanilla js.
  - Benefits:
    - Catch type-related mistakes.
    - Communicate type intent.
    - Provide IDE feedback.
  - Caveats
    - Inferencing is best-guess. not a gurantee.
    - Annotations are optional.
    - Any part of the application that isn't types introduces uncertainty.

- By default ts and flow to auto inferencing.
- Type aware linting

Deck: 134-135

// Lecture 4 - Validating Operand Types

// Lecture 6: Ts & Flow Summary

 Deck: 139-143
 Pros:
   - They make types more obvious in code.
   - Familiarity: they look like other language's type system.
   - Extremely popular these days.
   - They're very sophisticated and good at what they do.

// Lecture 7: Ts & Flow Summary
/*
 Deck: 144-149
 Cons:
   - Non-js standard syntax. [Creates system locking]
   - It require build process so it raises the barrier to entry.
   - Sophistication can be intimidating to without formal types experience.
   - the focus more on "static types" than value types.
