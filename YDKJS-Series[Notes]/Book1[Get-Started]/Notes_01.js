// Why I'm reading this book?
/*
  1. I want to build great web products/libraries/plugins which needs deep knowledge 
     of underlying principles of Js and Programming in General.
  2. I want to earn more [aka crack a good company] as a developer and have a decent living.

    My Favourite Quote: 
    ```
    So, do your future self a favor and dig into this book and unlock the knowledge within.
    These solid foundations will serve you better than any framework ever will;
    those come and go but we'll still be writing JavaScript itself for decades to come.
    Keep an open mind and challenge your preconceived notions
