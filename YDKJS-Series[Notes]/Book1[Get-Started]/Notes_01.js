    My Favourite Quote: 
    ```
    So, do your future self a favor and dig into this book and unlock the knowledge within.
    These solid foundations will serve you better than any framework ever will;
    those come and go but we'll still be writing JavaScript itself for decades to come.
    Keep an open mind and challenge your preconceived notions
    ```
