 # Things we look in an Enginner?
   - Analytical Problem solving with code. [Hitting a block and solve it.]
   - Technical Communication 
      - It means Can I implement your approach just from explanation?
      - Verbal communication enabling other to implement a feature.
   - Best practices: Debugging, Code Structure, patience and documentation.

// Lecture 2: Object Oriented Paradigm
/*
 # Syllabus: 
   1. Number of ways we can produce objects (data + functionality bundled up nicely.)
   2. Deep on call and apply.
   3. How prototype chain plays out
   4. Subclasses 
     I. Factory Function Style
     II. new Keyword Style
     III. new ES2015 Class Style
 
 
 # But.. why even we have this way of coding?
   - A code is all about data and applying functionality on it.
     Would not it be nice if we can bundle data and functionalaties 
     together instead of having code here and there?
 
 
 # OOP:
   - It is a paradigm to structure our complex code.
   - Easy to add features and functionality.
   - Easy for us and other developers to reason about (A clear structure).
   - Performant (Efficient in terms of memory).
 
 
 $ Jargons: 
   - Paradigm: Any approach to organise our code.[In context of coding]
   - Object: data + functionality.
